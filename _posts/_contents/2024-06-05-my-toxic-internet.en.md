As long as I can remember, there was always a computer at home.

One of my first games on it was Microsoft Word, where I could <span style="color:green">bea</span><span style="color:brown">*uti*</span><span style="color:red">ful</span><span style="color:blue">**ly**</span> colorize words in different shades. After some time, I discovered that in the XL shopping center, where they sold cartoon CDs, there were also CDs with games. I remember the game about the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" being very difficult, and I couldn't do anything in it. However, I really liked the game based on "Cars," which had a full open world. Probably since then, I've loved open-world games.

Although I was connected to the internet, it passed me by. I missed the wall that Durov took away and never returned, despite numerous requests. My VKontakte account was mainly needed for "Zombie Farm" and "Which Naruto Character Are You?" tests. Besides, I didn't have many friends in childhood, so all this nostalgia for Counter-Strike and the helicopter mission kind of passed me by.

But then everything somehow started to spin: my passion for programming, the boom of social networks -- and ten years later, my screen time is comparable to my waking time. Which, on the one hand, is scary, but on the other hand, constantly makes me reflect on how I got to this point.

<!--more-->

## Boom! BOOM!

I think there were two booms. The first was the gadget boom. When devices became compact enough, and batteries powerful enough to carry with you. Just recently, you had only a button Nokia, which could barely turn on Snake and the player, and now, boom -- cheap internet access and a screen from which you can see this internet well.

And it was really a matter of a few years when the main platforms formed on the market, the main social networks appeared for them, games like Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja came out, and websites started to poorly but still show mobile versions.

That was when my full connection happened. Firstly, I started actively subscribing to meme public pages. Secondly, I just got some friends, so I started actively chatting online. Thirdly, I started playing some online games on my phone, like Clash of Clans, which also had various communities. And it all became more and more accessible.

The second boom was algorithmic. Humanity learned to make it so that you come across content you hadn't seen before. Some platforms did this even before algorithms in the current understanding of this word, creating a good system of subscriptions and reposts. So it's hard to say exactly when recommendation systems started building our feeds. It seems to have been in the late 2010s. And then TikTok happened, which made a quiet revolution and left us in a brave new world of infinite content.

And that's it, we're all stuck in an internet that doesn't belong to us. I, of course, love it, but it's actually a mess.

## Just Do the Target Action, Please

In recent years, we've learned to feed machines a lot of data. For example, how many seconds you watched a video before swiping away. Regardless of whether you liked the video or not, the app itself will guess whether to show you more of the same and will adjust future feeds accordingly. There are memes about TikTok algorithms being able to determine LGBT affiliation and diagnose ADHD from the first 10 viewed videos. And it seems not far from the truth.

Algorithms need a metric that they maximize. And all IT products have become machines for optimizing such metrics.

I like the example of BeReal, which I recently described on the channel. I try to post my "late BeReal," and there's a different button in the usual spot, opening a menu for creating groups. I'd seen this feature before, but it was buried, as it should be, in a banner within the feed. And now I accidentally tapped it because they put it in the place of the old button.

I could literally feel at that moment that somewhere on the other side of this app sat product manager Jack, responsible for groups in BeReal. Investors pressured the CEO, who passed it all onto Jack: to secure big investments, increase user screen time in BeReal so that in a couple of years, they can start monetizing the app, which everyone now uses for free.

Poor Jack needs to make everyone spend more time in an app designed for people not to linger. So far, only the idea with three photos instead of one worked. Recently, he tested the concept of groups, but their first version didn't take off. Last week, he decided to change their location on the screen, and now he's analyzing the metrics.

In these metrics, there's a colossal growth — everyone is interested in the new feature, Jack's job is saved. On the other side of the screen, a hundred thousand people are spitting, opening group creation instead of the familiar camera window. But Jack doesn't care; he closes his insanely successful A/B test and leaves the button in the new spot.

And yesterday, I was watching a YouTube live stream, my phone froze during the ad, and half an hour later, I saw that some stupid game, like the ones they now churn out in tons, had installed itself. I cursed and deleted it. On Jack-2's graph, the average cost per app install decreased, and he doesn't care that I immediately deleted the game — it's no longer his problem but Jack-3's.

And that's the current state of the industry — Jacks of the world sweat so that users, like monkeys, do the target action. After which they hit their jackpot in the form of an annual bonus and move to the next company.

In Instagram, it's impossible to find a good half of the settings not because no one can figure out how to organize them properly, but because if you hide 95% of the buttons as deep as possible, you can free up space on the main screens for the most important things — ad posts, reels, and profile links. It will be impossible to miss.

Or, in my banking app, the pre-approved credit card banner is twice the size of the all-operations button, and it's positioned right under the thumb. Moreover, this banner competes with stories, and their content is created by competing advertisers who fight for the top three squares that don't require extra scrolling. I use only 35% of the screen because the remaining 65% is a constant experiment on me to find out how to make money on me more effectively.

And yes, I sometimes click on the stories — because, damn it, it's interesting what's in that card with the intriguing headline.

## The Curse of the Feed

I love it when an app thoughtfully suggests content from my favorite bloggers. I've discovered a million new interesting public pages because their post popped up in my recommendations. And I don't like Telegram as a social network because it doesn't have a feed.

But, damn it, it's silly to deny that half of my internet problems come from it.

The main tool for keeping me in the app is to make me believe that somewhere there's good content, and if I scroll a bit more, I'll definitely find it.

It turned out there's nothing better for this than making the content stream endless. No clear thematic division, just video after video. No quality assurance, no guarantee that I want to watch this. Just connect to a content source that should be interesting. It's even easier to train algorithms because you can insert not only my subscriptions but anything else as experiments, including pimple popping videos.

When I turned on automatic feed sorting by relevance, I stopped remembering what I was subscribed to. When they started slipping in third-party recommendations, I stopped subscribing altogether.

Now my subscriptions are literally stored somewhere on corporate servers, probably not even explicitly. Surely somewhere there's my anonymized profile, and the algorithm simply predicts what guys like me should be subscribed to. On one hand, it's amazing how well this works. On the other hand, it's scary as hell.

Both in Tinder and TikTok — if something isn't interesting, you can move on with a single touch. As a result, no one takes matches or their feed seriously because there's no feeling it's worth it — easier to just swipe further.

In the eighth grade, I played Clash of Clans and watched funny moments compilations on YouTube. Conceptually no different from my current Dota TikToks. But when I clicked on the "FUNNY MOMENTS CLASH OF CLANS" icon myself, I somehow more clearly realized that I'm spending time on jokes. Moreover, I knew that if I watched two seven-minute videos, it was already 15 minutes of similar content and time to switch. In the world of the endless feed, I disappear for an indefinite period and return to reality in the best case when I get bored, and in the worst — after two and a half hours.

And honestly, if I saw thumbnails of my current feed, I wouldn't want to watch most of it. But those 10 percent of good content... I understand everything, but, damn it, I don't want to miss it.


## New Formats

Content length has become quite interesting. I've noticed that content needs to be as short as possible to show as much variety as possible and better train algorithms.

But this is true only until the user becomes a fan of that content category. And if this is already known from historical data, then the length of videos should be increased immediately. This has already happened with YouTube, and I see the same thing on TikTok and Twitter.

For those who remember the good old 2015, the internet then consisted of 5-20 minute videos. This is Хорошо, +100500, and whatever else was popular. I used to watch videos about Clash of Clans. Long videos could last an hour, and even that was rare.

Dud’s interview with Face in 2017 was 50 minutes long. Maria Pevchikh’s interview in 2023 was 4 hours. The standard length of a podcast is now approaching an hour and a half, and particularly interesting videos are released in several parts. Videos about computer games have turned into streams -- now a single gamer-blogger generates not one 20-minute video a week, but a five-hour stream with recordings every day.

You know what I recently discovered? If you read a textual version of Schulman’s status instead, it takes about 15 minutes, even with constant distractions. This is comparable to watching a video at x4 speed, which would be impossible to comprehend in Schulman’s case.

![](../images/my-sweet-toxic-internet-05.JPG)

And news is a total mess. If something important happens, I learn about it instantly and get more information than I need. If there’s a terrorist attack, instead of three interactions with the news (a short fact; a big news piece with all the context; someone’s analytical video), I find myself involuntarily included in an endless live feed from the scene -- who said what, who was caught where, who confessed to what under torture. And it's not that you don’t need to know about this, but with endless headlines, reposts, and tweets, I see every news piece and every analysis five times.

And then they wonder why our generation has brain anxiety.

## Creators and Trends

The internet has always been a place where original creators thrived. But several things have happened. First, being a good creator has become profitable -- a million lifestyle bloggers have appeared whose primary goal is not self-expression but maximum popularity. Second, with the increase in overall screen time, it has become much easier to get a non-zero audience. I have social capital on the internet that almost doubles my social capital in real life, and I'm a nobody by social media standards.

I don’t know about you, but I have a whole group of acquaintances who go online once every six months and suddenly start actively using Instagram for a couple of days until they get bored. And it’s always some kind of self-promotional content, tailored to the trends. Every time they start with stories like “wow, I haven’t been here in a while, so much has happened!”, they start talking about something, and it turns out that not much has happened. They usually make a series of stories about how they recently rethought something and became a completely different person. But I’ve seen the exact same meaningful story with the exact same pretext six months ago, damn it, I’m not a goldfish.

Spiritual rebirth on Instagram is when you make five stories every six months about how you are now a new person and then do the same thing as before. At least they could tell us where exactly the updates happened. But everything is vague and filled with quotes from public pages either about successful success or self-love.

In the online world, to be known, you need to stand out and be unique. Because, obviously, that makes you more interesting to the audience. Unless you're doing trends.

For a while, I thought I understood these rules of the game, but trends just don’t fit into my worldview. Trends are the direct opposite of creativity; at best, it’s a successful meme adaptation, at worst, it’s like a repost. So, on one hand, social networks promote unusual content well, and on the other hand, they promote the most primitive form of content in principle.

![](../images/my-sweet-toxic-internet-03.JPG)

The most absurd part, of course, is the discussions on how to be successful in blogging and hack the algorithms. What trends to shoot, what video release schedule to have, and so on. It’s all some kind of magical thinking. All processes of a video going viral happen more or less randomly and uncontrollably. But if you're a full-time (or wannabe) creator, you need to believe in some magic because otherwise, it turns out your entire career is just hanging on the will of randomness.

## Content

With the abundance of creators, content is mainly shaped by the demands of the audience they broadcast to. And the audience wants the most outstanding and unusual content. As a result, everyone engages in some kind of clownery for views, and it turns out that outstanding content is not that unusual. All the funny videos with animals and children have already been shot, all the tricks have been done, the most beautiful places on the planet have been visited, so everything is secondary. As they say, it’s already been on The Simpsons.

I’ve seen more than one or two accounts of small businesses that end up with more or less the same content. Someone sells gift boxes, someone knits sweaters, someone makes candles, and the content is identical -- stories about the most unusual orders, retellings of arguments with customers, responses to comments like “why is it so expensive?”. And the endless trends, those fucking trends, but I’ve already said everything about them. Only the visuals change from account to account, that’s the only difference.

A constant stream of unusual content creates an alternate reality where the wow-effect is dead. For example, I play Dota, so I have a lot of clips in TikTok showing someone playing well. And they only show heroes single-handedly wiping out the entire enemy team in a couple of hits. It’s impressive, but completely detached from my games, where you spend 20 minutes hitting creeps for gold.

I have some TikToks about corporate life. There’s an account that posts videos like “WORST BOSS EVER #117”. Damn, there can’t be 100 worst bosses if the content of the videos is absolutely the same -- the boss either promised a promotion and didn’t give it, or scheduled a shift in the middle of a vacation. Worst boss #1 and Worst boss #2, that’s all.

![](../images/my-sweet-toxic-internet-06.JPG)

There’s also unexpected toxicity from educational content. Thanks to TikToks about food, I’ve heard the same spiel about different steak doneness 200 times. I have a clear feeling that this is common knowledge. But when I talk to people, no one is interested in it in the real world. There’s a strong urge to start being a know-it-all at these moments because, well, everyone should know this already if it’s all over the internet.

Or, I watch live coding videos on YouTube where guys make projects on the fly in an hour (and secretly dream of doing similar ones myself). It all looks incredibly easy, but I know from experience that even the simplest project takes a ton of time. Moreover, I watch a 12-minute video on YouTube about developing a small computer game, and on Twitter, I see a guy who teaches computer graphics at a Russian university spending a week on a similar project.

In general, the most useful skill of the modern age is to go outside and touch grass to not confuse real reality with recommended reality.


## Crab Bucket Success

As someone who achieved success in the national informatics olympiad, I regularly encounter people from the wider internet community, unrelated to olympiads, asking how they can also participate. I share my experience and caution them about the pitfalls along the way, emphasizing that my case, where I earned a diploma in a year, isn't typical, and usually, it takes 2-3 years. I make it clear that I dedicated a year of my life to this pursuit.

Out of those who came straight from the streets, not having attended a good school, only one person also succeeded like me. I observed him and saw his dedication and how he also worked tirelessly for that diploma. The rest did not reach this stage. And I think they shouldn't have, because by definition, something difficult should only be achievable by a small fraction of those who attempt it. If you achieve something difficult, you're more likely an exception confirming the general rule.

People who are successful on the internet or sell their success from real life can either be exceptions to the rule or fraudsters. As far as I know, these are the only possibilities. Even if it's an Instagram girl just posting pictures of her ass -- she's still doing something challenging. Not because taking photos of your butt is incredibly difficult, but because if I wanted to pursue such a career, I wouldn't succeed.

![Image](../images/my-sweet-toxic-internet-01.JPG)

This doesn't mean you should never try to do something. Being an exception to the rule isn't so difficult -- it's enough to find yourself where the rules of the game suit you very well. I find it relatively easy to operate with abstractions, but difficult to connect my identity with my body, so I engage in coding rather than modeling.

The good news is that almost all industries now have bloggers, podcasters, and public experts willing to share their knowledge with the audience. Importantly, there's a growing trend not only in primary educational content but also in secondary anecdotal content. Roughly speaking, it's not just about programming, but also about how interviews are conducted in the industry and how startups differ from corporations. And this trend isn't limited to IT; it's penetrating other industries as well.

The bad news is that it's very easy to get hooked on such content, as on small steps towards achieving a goal that require no action. After one cycle of lectures, you go to listen to another cycle of lectures, then you watch podcasts with experts, instead of doing something yourself. And at some point, you might find yourself on the plateau of an armchair expert -- when you've heard about everything but haven't done anything yet, and you underestimate the magnitude of the path you need to take by several orders of magnitude.

In general, to win olympiads, you need to solve problems, and to program well, you need to work on projects. <strike>And you can read more detailed guides weekly on my Patreon!</strike>

## Internet Opinions

In addition to entertainment and educational content, we often consume media content, political content, and just opinions on arbitrary topics. Isn't the internet a place where everyone can express themselves, right?

If everyone had an equal chance to express themselves, it might have been like that. But we have platforms that promote content that increases screen time. And the best content for this purpose is arguments and dramas.

Today's news is of no interest to anyone if there are no sensational headlines. No one wants to hear the basics if there's some unpopular opinion around which you can argue in the comments.

And this is the perfect breeding ground for radicalization. Your hot take is reposted by a thousand accounts. Another thousand accounts, who disagree with the take, are busy calling you idiots in the comments. And why listen to those who call you idiots? You need to call them idiots in return!

And the further it goes, the more shit hits the fan. No one wants to deal with those who disagree with them. And there's hardly any difference in how much they disagree with you. Usually, there's just a division into "ours" and "theirs." So, for example, it happens on Twitter, where people put emojis in their nicks, and you already know in advance what values they declare.

And the same thing happens outside of Twitter. We brand those who disagree with us as "Zetniks," anti-vaxxers, or fucking liberals. And, generally, after that, we stop taking them seriously.

![Image](../images/my-sweet-toxic-internet-04.JPG)

Not that it's particularly illogical -- because the average representative of the other group will use the average arguments of that group, and you've heard them and you already have ready-made counterarguments, and so on. You can throw answers at each other for a very long time, following the manual, until one compares the other to Hitler.

Products are getting more expensive everywhere, but there's absolutely no discussion about it on the internet. It's an important topic, but since there's no conflict in the comments, everyone doesn't give a fuck. But if you review your Parisian grocery basket and show the price tag of chicken at 10 euros per kilo, then a hundred Muscovites with chicken at 300 rubles will come to the comments first, then twenty Parisians will say their cheese is tastier and there's no Putin. Sooner or later, it all ends up with a comparison to Hitler, because the products themselves didn't bother anyone. The only concern was who to call an idiot today.

There's cool statistics about how many Americans belong to a particular social group -- based on social surveys and assessments by other Americans. And somewhere the numbers are just fantastic. LGBTQ+, which is estimated at almost 50%, is less than 10%, and the trans community is 0.01% instead of an estimate of 20%. Why? Well, it's clear why, because they're disproportionately focused on in public discourse, which virtually inflates their representativeness.

<!-- https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/41556-americans-misestimate-small-subgroups-population-->

The audience not only shapes topics for videos but also radicalizes itself. You'll hear the same thought twenty times from different creators. At some point, you'll get tired, and they'll show you another, more radical one. And step by step, you'll gradually go from memes about life lessons in school to the fact that corporations, Jeff Bezos, and other white cisgender men are to blame, or that migrants, lazy youth, and black trans people are to blame.

## Internet Facts

You'd think that if internet opinions are so scary, internet facts should have come, where everyone listens only to experts. But in the end, we just found experts for each camp.

The bullshit on the internet was well predicted by memes like "British scientists." It must be admitted that for a long time it was just a meme, and everything on the internet was true except for the most obvious bullshit. The concept of "it's all a scam to gain clicks" existed when clicks weren't volatile.

But when people started mass-producing content for cash, passing audience views as reality became profitable. Moreover, it turned out to be not that difficult. It's enough to present carefully selected info-events and take comments from experts in the corresponding camp. These are very conditional experts -- for their audience, Poddubny is as much an authority as Schulman is for his, just with different material and presentation.

And yes, you can say that some camps engage in argumentation, and others don't. But we've figured that out too -- if the facts don't match the beliefs, then those facts are fake, and they're stirred up by Masons, trolls, and cut into fakes. And now it's not just for conspiracy theories. For example, Prigozhin has a bot factory, and Free Russia has a bot factory. If such a tool exists, both sides will use it, and it's not so much immoral as new rules of the game.

![Image](../images/my-sweet-toxic-internet-02.JPG)

Of course, you can choose the only correct option -- read a bunch of sources and studies yourself, different perspectives, look at arguments and facts, and form your own opinion.

But there are alternative options. You can present stereotypes as reality. You can cover statistics with bright videos that contradict the statistics. For example, in the US, there's a constant discussion about the free sale of weapons, and the statistics say that freely purchased weapons are more likely to harm your own residents. But Republicans have a stack of news headlines where an armed person fought off a robber.

Someone might come to you with links to sources and statistics in the comments. But you can just say, "Hey, are you crazy?" And who will be right? I believe it's those with facts. But if I can be beaten up or jailed for my facts, then I'll seriously reconsider how important the truth is to me. And if you have a homophobic society, then a fighter for LGBT rights must go against democracy to push his policy? And this again, if he isn't caught near the entrance and squeezed out of the country.

Recent years have greatly increased overall political involvement, making every action and life choice a political statement. And it seems that the emergence of platforms that help everyone to be heard eventually led us to the center of chaos and feeling infinitely confused. Well, except for radicals, they're doing fine.

## Screen Time

I want to spend less time on the internet. Actually, everyone I know would agree with that. The problem is that the internet is the universal answer to the question "what to do?"

There's a metaphor that compares life to a jar into which you can pour rocks, smaller pebbles, and handfuls of sand. Filling the jar indicates what we fill our lives with. So, in this metaphor, the internet is like a liquid that can fill everything to the brim.

I'm someone with hobbies. I have a sport that I love and engage in once or twice a week. I enjoy playing Dota periodically. I have Paris to wander through, and I write blog posts, create longreads, and try to edit videos. I have a million unfinished projects planned. Besides hobbies, I have a wife and beer to keep me company.

But all of this requires time. Training in the forest takes three hours, a Dota game takes 50 minutes, and writing posts and working on projects requires getting into a flow state after work. You don't drink beer with your wife in the middle of the day.

But hopping onto Twitter and TikTok is easy. And that's all that's needed. I used to play some games on my phone just for appearance's sake, but now I only have Sudoku and chess, which I play when there's absolutely no internet. Because nothing dilutes the brain more than a ready-made answer to the question "what to do?" And if one answer doesn't suit you, the next one is immediately offered.

Those who say you should read a book instead of using the internet are wrong because they suggest putting another rock in the jar instead of water. It doesn't work that way; the internet is absolutely irreplaceable in this regard because nothing else has learned to make decisions for us yet.

![Image](../images/my-sweet-toxic-internet-10.JPG)

I think there's no real way out of this situation. There's no alternative to replace excessive screen time if it's wasted in vain. Either the jar has liquid, or it needs to be emptied. It's easier said than done because it might turn out that part of the jar isn't filled with anything at all. You might find yourself sitting in a room unable to do anything.

I personally avoid this because such a state stimulates existential fear — if I'm not doing anything, then I don't exist. But someone else avoids reality simply because reality sucks, and they don't want to live in it. This means you either need to sort out your head or deal with problems from the real world.

But it's fucking hard; I'm tired, and there's a funny video right there.


## Conclusion

I feel like I'm visiting Instagram less frequently. There's been nothing interesting in my feed for a while now, with more ads in stories than actual content, and reels are just a nightmare. Lately, I've been using it as a social network business card. By the way, feel free to follow me.

For my circle, VK seems lost, purely due to political reasons. But there was a peak of popularity when you could customize it well for yourself, and creators didn't flee in fear from the authorities. That's when I really loved it.

Telegram, of course, serves as my primary means of communication, a news source, and a subscription to friends' channels. I follow meme channels of my acquaintances and some separate blogs, which on this platform have very modest numbers due to its specific nature.

I spend a lot of time on TikTok. Firstly, because it shows me interesting creators and international discussions, a pure form of the internet. Secondly, when the substantive videos end, I spend another half-hour watching Dota and cooking out of inertia. I haven't figured out how to separate the first from the second yet.

There's also Twitter, where there are many cool individuals. However, with Musk, they started shoving in short videos like "popular" into the feed, and it's impossible to read for more than 10 minutes. But it's not that bad — in 10 minutes, I see what's new, and then only crap remains, which is unbearable to watch. TikTok should really do the same.

YouTube is still holding up well, largely due to archival content that I periodically rediscover for myself. I want to learn how to make videos for it myself.

I spend a lot of time on the internet, but I don't feel like I belong there. I feel a direct conflict with where everything is heading. More and more often, there's a desire to communicate directly with each other, to return from recommendation feeds to subscription lists.

You can't imagine the pleasure I've been getting lately from original content from random corners of the internet. Someone's blog posts, tweets, articles, channels, videos, songs, TikToks. Actually, nowadays, most content can be considered original unless ChatGPT wrote it. It's more accurate to say that lately, I've been enjoying the independence of creators from their audience and their freedom to be themselves.

I really want my presence on the internet to be like that too.
