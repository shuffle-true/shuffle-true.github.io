# Projects

[<ins>SimSearch</ins>](https://github.com/kik0s/similarity-search-coursework) <br>
Coursework paper about service developed in Tinkoff.ru. Research of ANN problem. Presenting architecture of search engine for any type of object. This approach led to a content-based image search service.<br>
[<ins>Perlin noise heatmap</ins>](https://github.com/kik0s/perlin-noise-heatmap) <br>
Visualization of Perlin noise with heatmap and marching squares technique. Rust OpenGL interactive application.<br>
[<ins>3d-renderer from scratch</ins>](https://github.com/kik0s/3d-framework) <br>
Library for processing 3d scenes and rendering them in real-time. Uses only "set pixel" graphic primitive from SFML library, rasterization is self-written as well as scene manager.<br>
[<ins>Digitalization of orienteering maps</ins>](https://github.com/KiK0S/maps-analyzer) <br>
Labeled image dataset, setup augmentation pipeline for semantic segmentation problem. Tested different approaches, currently the best is one using U-Net. <br>
[<ins>OpenCV mini-projects in Rust</ins>](https://github.com/KiK0S/cv_projects)<br>
Rust bindings for OpenCV used for sketch filter, shape detection, template search.<br>
